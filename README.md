# Snakes-Ladders-C-Programming
I was asked to create a snakes and ladders game in C for
an assignment. I really enjoyed doing this assignment as
we had to put all the knowledge we learnt about C,
during the year, together. I implemented the snakes and
ladders game using pointers. The biggest challenge was
displaying the board in the console. I figured out a way
to reverse every second row when displaying to the user.
I received 95% for this assignment.
